# DevFest Melbourne Enro Sample

This is a sample project for the DevFest Melbourne 2024 conference.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a sample project, and does a few "bad" things, like using raw strings in the UI instead of using resources, or
> avoiding ViewModels and calling Repositories directly in the UI. Treat this project as an example of how Enro can be used, not
> as a best practice guide.
